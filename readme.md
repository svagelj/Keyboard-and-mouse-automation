This is a small fast and dirty little project for pressing keys on a keyboard and moving mouse with a python script. The aim of this project is to be useful to every one that can run this python script and not worry about automation part. 

It has a main infinite loop that can be broken out of it by specifying the number of key presses. You can build up a cycle variable to repeat certain key strokes or mouse movements and presses.

Each button press has a given duration and wait time after the press. You can specify wait time for each key press or use a default value.

Have fun!
